                <h5>Conformance to Consumer Protection Acts: </h5>


                <p>‘moolya’ seeks to be a self-discovery platform and hence services may be rendered by users for other
                  users on the platform as well as in offline mode. Out of the various laws that have been enforced to
                  protect the consumer rights in India, the most important is the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Each of
                  the user who wishes to operate on ‘moolya’ for rendering any services, expressly agrees to abide by

                  to exercise their consumer rights for the purchase of goods and services made by them. It is
                  significant that, as consumer, one knows the basic rights as well as about the courts and procedures

                <h5>Guidance on transferring personal data to external organisations:</h5>


                <p>Personal Data is defined under the Data Protection Acts or similar ones for various countries. It is
                  generally defined as data which relates to a living individual who can either be identified from that
                  data; or identified from that data and other data which may be in the possession of or likely to come
                  into the possession of the data controller. This will include any expression of opinion about that
                  person. Personal Data will include ‘Name, Date of Birth, Address, Telephone numbers and “sensitive
                  personal data” eg. Financial History, racial or ethnic origin. ‘moolya’ collects a wide range of
                  personal data relating to the users of the platform/website, for its own purposes, and to meet
                  external obligations. This may result in the eventual transfer of personal data to an outside third
                  party, however any such transfers must be permitted under the acts permitted as per India’s law of the
                  land. Personal data must not be disclosed to unauthorised third parties. Unauthorised third parties
                  include another individual or organisation, family members, friends, local authorities, government
                  bodies, and the police where the individual has not consented to the transfer unless disclosure is
                  exempted appropriate Acts, or by other legislation. There is no general legal requirement to disclose
                  information to the police unless specified in a proper and legitimate form. However, data can
                  sometimes be disclosed without consent, where, for example, it is required for:</p>


                <ul>


                  <li> Protecting the vital interests of the data subject (i.e. release of medical data in emergency),
                    or
                  </li>

                  <li> The prevention or detection of crime</li>


                </ul>


                <p>Personal Data can be transferred to another third party if the data subject has given their consent.
                  ‘moolya’ maybe/is frequently required to disclose information in accordance with legislation which it
                  is subject to. Legal services can be availed by the prospective users of ‘moolya’ for advice on
